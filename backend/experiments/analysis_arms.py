GROUNDING CORRECTION

Your previous analysis is below, together with every quotation in it that could
not be found in the source it names. Re-emit the complete JSON object.

For each quotation listed:
- If the claim is supported by the source, replace exact_quote with the sentence
  as it appears there, copied character for character.
- If nothing in the sources supports the claim, say so through the claim's
  epistemic status or record it as a gap.

Do not delete a claim merely because its quotation was wrong. A claim the
sources do support is worth keeping with a corrected quotation, and an analysis
that says less is not a better one.

Change nothing else. Every other claim, party, moment, impact, gap and
association must come back as it was.
