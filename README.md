# CyberCase Intelligence Framework

CyberCase is a full-stack prototype for general case summarization and preliminary case analysis. It accepts user-authored narratives and uploaded documents, extracts document text, identifies unresolved information gaps, produces a structured analysis, binds supported claims back to Case sources, and assembles a deterministic report.

The current production path is source-bounded and domain-neutral. MITRE ATT&CK retrieval is an optional external technical augmentation; it is not required for the core case-analysis path and is never treated as a Case source.

Research notes and earlier design reviews are in [`research/notes/`](research/notes/). Each describes the project as it was on the date it was written.

## Trust boundary and source roles

- **Case sources**: user narratives and extracted text from uploaded documents. Case sources and answered follow-ups (below) are the only inputs that can support case facts, timelines, entities, and findings.
- **Follow-up history**: answers to clarification questions are persisted as Case chat messages. A later analysis may cite an answer as `QA-nn` to support a claim, the same way it cites a source (`followup_registry_items` in `backend/app/trace/bind.py` puts each answered follow-up beside the sources, in the reading input and in the binding index). An answer is still not a `CaseSource` row and does not increment `source_revision`.
- **External context**: assistant responses, MITRE descriptions, RAG retrieval, and general model knowledge are not Case sources and cannot establish incident facts.
- **Traceability**: each claim cites the source units it rests on by ID. The backend resolves those IDs to the exact text and offsets of the source bundle and the answered follow-ups, and records a reference it cannot resolve as invalid.

## Runtime flow

                     ↓

                     ↓
                     Judgement, views and claim check, side by side
                     ↓
                     Validated analysis → Report
```

The assessment may stop the request before technical augmentation, the analysis calls, and binding. When the case proceeds, a reading call writes the claims, each citing the source units it rests on, and the backend binds those units to the source text. Then three things run at once: a judgement call writes the summary and gaps over the checked claims, a views call lists the parties, timeline and impacts, and the claim check labels each claim. The ATT&CK associations are not written by a model: the backend lists the techniques the RAG service tied to a sentence of the case, with that sentence. Analysis and Case Ask operations are request-scoped; there is no run resource, job queue, or polling workflow.

Report generation is separate, deterministic, and template-first. It reads a selected validated analysis and what that analysis recorded when it was stored: the sources it read and the follow-up answers it had. Each analysis gets at most one report. The report is stored as a display snapshot, and the HTML and PDF are rendered from that stored copy. No model is called.

## Components

- `frontend/`: Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, TypeScript
- `backend/`: FastAPI, async SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Alembic
- `rag_service/`: optional standalone GraphRAG service backed by Qdrant and Neo4j

The browser calls only the backend. Authentication and per-user Case ownership are enforced by the backend.

## Persistence

PostgreSQL stores Cases, uploaded documents, native Case sources (narratives, and the text extracted from each document with its pages and warnings in `provenance_json`), the Case source revision, analysis results, Case-owned chat messages, optional technical retrieval context, and reports. The schema is created by the Alembic migrations in `backend/alembic/versions/`: `0001_initial_schema.py`, and `0002_source_deactivation.py`, which lets a source be turned off. An analysis result can have `status="assessment"` while a clarification question is pending or `status="validated"` after full analysis and source binding.

There is no `CaseRun` table. The backend reads a source bundle, releases the database transaction during model or external-service work, and stores the result in a later short transaction. A result is rejected if the Case source revision changed while the request was running.

## API boundary

All application routes use `/api/v1`. The primary surface is authenticated Case CRUD, document upload and extraction, Case sources, request-scoped analysis, Case chat, and Case reports. There is no public upload/OCR route, top-level report route, run-status route, or browser-to-`rag_service` route.

## Development conventions

- Python backend modules use `snake_case`; frontend functions and variables use `camelCase`, with PascalCase React components.
- There is no line-count limit. Split a file when that makes it easier to read, test or own (see `AGENTS.md`).
- Keep LLM semantics in analysis steps and keep validation, routing, persistence, stopping rules, and report assembly deterministic.

## Run

```powershell
doppler run -- docker compose up --build
```

Or run services separately. `install_deps.py` installs `backend/requirements-dev.txt` (the backend plus its test tools) and `rag_service/requirements.txt` into the active Python environment:

```powershell
python install_deps.py
cd backend
doppler run -- python -m alembic upgrade head
doppler run -- uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/case`; backend OpenAPI is at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Checks

The backend's PostgreSQL tests are skipped unless `CYBERCASE_TEST_DATABASE_URL` points at a test database.

```powershell
cd backend
python -m pytest -q
cd ..\frontend
npm run test
npm run lint
npm run build
```
